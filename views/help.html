        <dt>Why do we make quotes?</dt>
        <dd>By creating quotes based on scriptures and quotes from our lessons we can help spread the Gospel to people all over the world, 
          and internalize the messages of the lesson as we look for principles which can be applied to our lives.</dd>
        
        <dt>How do I make a quote for a lesson?</dt>
      <dd>First, check out other quotes on our <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/studentsofseminary">instagram page</a>. Here are the steps for making quotes:
            <ol>
                <li>Read through the lesson and find a relevant quote from a scripture verse referenced in the lesson, or from one of the Prophets quoted in the lesson.</li>
                <li>Go to <a href="http://images.lds.org">images.lds.org</a> and download a relevant image to use as the background to your quote</li>
                <li>
                    <h6>Download a quote app such as Phonto <img height="50px" class="app-icon" src="images/phonto.png"></h6>
                    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phonto-text-on-image/id438429273?mt=8"><img height="40" src="images/appstorebadge.png"></a>
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.youthhr.phonto"><img height="40" src="images/googleplaybadge.png"></a>
                </li>
                <li>
                Using Phonto, load the image you downloaded from <a href="http://images.lds.org">images.lds.org</a> as your background image, and paste the quote onto the image. 
                It may take some time to learn  how to use Phonto to correctly position the quote and make it readable. 
                One way to make sure your quote is readable is to give the text a white color, a black 2 pixel stroke (outline color) and a black shadow.
